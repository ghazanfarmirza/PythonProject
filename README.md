# PythonProject


Calculate the number of responses from employees for a certain year and month â€¨â€¨To run this project, first we have to download few dependencies, P.s (I have used venv(python virtual environment) â€¨â€¨If you have python installed then to activate the the virtual environment â€¨here are the few steps â€¨
1.  pip install virtualenv (install virtual environment)
2.  virtualenv mypython (To create a virtual environment, you must specify a path. For example to create one in the local directory called â€˜mypythonâ€™, type the following command above)
3.  source mypython/bin/activate (ctivate the python environment by running the following command above) 


After that, 
Letâ€™s get you set up for your first Google Drive API project.
First, go toÂ https://console.developers.google.com/Â from your browser. This will take you to Google Console page (just like AWS console page, if youâ€™re familiar with it) where you can manage your API and services, IAM and admin.

If this is your first time, from the left navigation bar, go toÂ APIs & ServicesÂ >Â Dashboard.
ï¿¼

It will bring you to Google API & Services Dashboard where it lists all the projects you have, if any. But, since this is your first time, you will have no project listed. Go on and click onÂ CREATE.

ï¿¼


Now, you will land on a page where you can create a new project and specify the name of it (andÂ Organization, if you manage an organisation or else you can leave this blank). In this example, we will name our project asÂ First Medium Project. Go on and click onÂ CREATE.

The first thing we need to do is to enable the Google Sheets API. Now, open your browser and go toÂ https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard. Then, make sure you are on the right project and if not, select the right project from the drop down list.

Go ahead and click on it. Once you land on the Google Sheets API page, click on theÂ ENABLEÂ button to enable this API.
ï¿¼


ï¿¼

After that, if you just go to the Credentials tab, you will see that it says our credentials we set up earlier for Google Drive API is compatible with the Sheets API. This means we can use the credentials that we already have and set up for our script. ðŸ™‚


Create Credentials
After you enable the Google Drive API, itâ€™s time to createÂ credentialsÂ so that you application canÂ authenticateÂ itself when trying to access Google Drive resources later on.


ï¿¼


At first, it might be overwhelming to choose the type of credentials that you need. Google has done a great job in creating a set of questions to help you figure out which credentials to create. Just follow the instructions on the next few photos


ï¿¼
 In the above screenshot, select the Google Sheets Api 



Set Up OAuth Consent Screen and Add API Scope
After you fill up the above questionnaire, Google will recommend that you application requires theÂ OAuth client IDÂ and before you can set this up, you need to set upÂ OAuth consent screen.

ï¿¼


ï¿¼




Now, we are going to add theÂ scopeÂ that we want our application to be able to do. Scope is like giving permissions to our credentials which then determine what our application has access to. For this tutorial, we need our application to be able toÂ see,Â download,Â create,Â editÂ andÂ deleteÂ all of your files in Google Drive. (You can include whatever scope you would like here, best practice is to only include what your application will do).

ï¿¼

After that, select all checkboxes 


ï¿¼


Once finished, click theÂ AddÂ button and then it will take us to the previous page. Go on and clickÂ Save.



Create Credentials: Client Secret (OAuth Client ID)
Next, we are going to add our credentials so that Google can identify who our application is and what scope it has, etc. This is known as theÂ Client Secret. Go on and click onÂ Create credentialsÂ >Â OAuth client ID.

ï¿¼


For this, we are going to selectÂ OtherÂ as our Application type as we will build a command line application. But, you can choose whatever type of application you want to build.

ï¿¼


After this step, you are going to have yourÂ Client Secret, which you can download so your application can use it to authenticate itself. Go on and click on theÂ Download, which is the down arrow icon. Your client secret is aÂ JSONÂ file. Rename it toÂ client_secret.json.



ï¿¼


In order to be able to access the API resources, we need to get the access token. Since the API resources that we want to access contain sensitive scope (accessing files in Google Drive), we need to do a browser authentication for the first time.




MacBook-Pro:~ bobthedude$ virtualenv venv_google_api
MacBook-Pro:~ bobthedude$ source venv_google_api/bin/activate
# install all the dependent packages
(venv_google_api) MacBook-Pro:~ bobthedude$ pip install google-api-python-client oauth2client



Create a folder in the project directory calledÂ credentialsÂ to store yourÂ client_secret.jsonÂ which you can download from yourÂ Google Console


Your project structure should look like this to begin with. TheÂ connect_to_google_drive.pyÂ is the Python file that contains instructions to connect to Google Drive API.


ï¿¼


Letâ€™s write the code that needs to go intoÂ connect_to_google_drive.py.

from apiclient import discovery
from httplib2 import Http
from oauth2client import client, file, tools


# define path variables
credentials_file_path = './credentials/credentials.json'
clientsecret_file_path = './credentials/client_secret.json'

# define API scope
SCOPE = 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'

# define store
store = file.Storage(credentials_file_path)
credentials = store.get()
# get access token
if not credentials or credentials.invalid:
    flow = client.flow_from_clientsecrets(clientsecret_file_path, SCOPE)
    credentials = tools.run_flow(flow, store)




Your access token will be stored inÂ credentials/credentials.jsonÂ upon the browser authentication, which I will go through after this.
Now, save the file and go to yourÂ terminal. Follow below commands to get your access token.Â Note: if you execute the above script from an IDE (I useÂ PyCharm), you would get an error. For the first time only, you need to execute the script from yourÂ terminal

ï¿¼


A browser tab will open after the above command execution. Select the Google account on which you set up your API and credentials in the previous step. Then click onÂ Allow.


ï¿¼


Once again, Google will prompt you and ask for a confirmation if you want to allow yourÂ First Medium ApplicationÂ to access your Google Drive files. Go on and click onÂ Allow.

ï¿¼


If successful, your browser will return a page with the following textÂ The authentication flow has completed. And if you go back to yourÂ terminal, you should see an additional 2 lines (indicating authentication success) printed as follows.


ï¿¼


Additionally, you will see a new fileÂ credentials.jsonÂ gets created in theÂ credentialsÂ folder. Awesome job! We have now obtained our access token which we can use to connect to Google Drive API resources.


ï¿¼


After the credentials verification â€¨â€¨

Nice! Our code becomes so much cleaner and easier to follow now. ðŸ™‚
With this newÂ main.pyÂ script, the way we can call it from the command line is as follows



With this newÂ main.pyÂ script, the way we can call it from the command line is as follows

Run this program â€¨â€¨$ python main.py --spreadsheet-name "Christmas Plan" --sheet-name Sheet2

It would download the csv and then you can apply the logic to get the desired luck
